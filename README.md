# School-Event-Management-System-NFC-Native-Android
An android application that manages the events in our school. The main purpose of this system is to record and track the student's performance within school. It collects the attendance, membership fee status, or even make a transaction (eg: merchandise). It can also generate and read an NFC tag. The server was hosted in Firebase. This will be only a demo due to data sensitivity. If you would like to go deeper for some reason, contact me first. :)
